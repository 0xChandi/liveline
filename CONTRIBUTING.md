# Contributing to Liveline

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Before You Start

Open an issue first, especially for larger changes. It helps talk through the approach and avoids wasted effort.

## What's Welcome

- **Bug fixes** — Always welcome.
- **Performance improvements** — This is a 60fps canvas library. Faster is always better.
- **Small, focused features** — Things that solve common charting problems without adding complexity.
- **Visual and animation improvements** — Welcome, but have a high bar. Open an issue to discuss first.

## What's Harder to Merge

- **New props and options** — The API surface is intentionally small. New props need to earn their place.
- **More configuration** — Opinionated defaults over flexibility.
- **Non-canvas rendering** — Liveline is canvas-only by design.

## Code Style

- Match existing patterns
- Keep PRs focused (one change per PR)
- No external runtime dependencies beyond React

## Questions?

Open an issue. Happy to talk through ideas.
